# swappy

A Wayland native snapshot tool, inspired by Snappy on macOS

## Configuration

If you are using [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway), it is recommended to set Swappy as a floating window. To do this, add the following line to your sway config file:

```
for_window [app_id="swappy"] floating enable
```
